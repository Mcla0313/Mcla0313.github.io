        <h1>More Information about myself</h1>
        <p>
            As a student studying Interative Media Design at Algonquin College,
            I have been taught many skills and industry standards such as coding languages and content managment
            systems.
        </p>

        <p>throughout highschool I had known that I wanted to take this course. Thus I focused on taking media and art
            elective courses. From Media Arts to photography I have studied and planned so I could go into this course
            prepared.</p>

        <p>This website was created to act as my portfolio and show off my best content Ive created over the past couple
            of years from coding style sheets to redesigning logos I have experience with designing lots of different
            content. </p>
