            <h3>Featured Image: "Molly"</h3>
            <p>When i took this image what I wanted the viewer to focus on is the texture and the environment shown. I
                feel like those
                two elements really add alot to the photo

        <p>When I took this picture I was just starting this course and I really wanted to explore and test my abilities as a creative so I had followed this train track for about 2km just to get the right picture.</p>
