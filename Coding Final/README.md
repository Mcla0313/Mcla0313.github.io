During the process of making this portfolio I had really wanted the focus to make sure that the site represents me. From the colors and typography to the images and logo I wanted the site to 
represent me. Throughout the process, it was a pretty steady untill I had hit the grid portion. I have always struggled with making grids, thankfully I was able to get one working but the other was not responding well. Thus I chose to work with Bootstrap, it was a great choice and helped give my site a well structured look. On the other hand, finding content was difficult untill I opted to use my photography final photos to fill and show off my content. I chose to do it this way because those pictures are something I am proud of and does represent me through the hobbies and environments I chose to include in the pictures. What I have learned from making this portfolio is that it is crutial that you take time to plan out your portfolio and if you invest the proper amount of time, it will pay off with a clean and professional site.
